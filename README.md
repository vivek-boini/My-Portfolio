# My-Portfolio

Building this portfolio with Tailwind CSS was an exciting and rewarding experience! As my first project using only HTML and Tailwind, I learned how to efficiently style responsive layouts without custom CSS. Structuring components like cards, navigation, and forms with utility classes improved my workflow, while hover effects and smooth scrolling added polish. The biggest challenge was ensuring mobile-first responsiveness, but Tailwindâ€™s breakpoint prefixes made it intuitive. This project solidified my understanding of modern front-end development and gave me a professional showcase for my skills. Looking forward to enhancing it further with animations and more dynamic content!
